How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was
introduced?

diff(mac) and FC(Windows) isolated the areas of the files that contained differences and 
organized them so that they are easier to see

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?

you can compare older versions to the newer versions easily so you can spot the differences
easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like
you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

manual pros: user control, flexibility, judgment call; manual cons: judgment might be 
nonsensical, user might forget to save; automatic pros: no risk of user forgetting, 
many files to choose from; automatic cons: too many files to choose from, saves the
smallest changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is primarily used for coding and saving multiple files is very useful when making
programs that use multiple files (e.g. web development), whereas Google Drive is not used
for coding and does not assume that any documents may be related 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives you a log of all the commits while git diff shows all the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
something?

using version control allows me to checkout previous versions of the file; from these, I
can find the source of error

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I can use Git to organize my files and perhaps share them in the future
