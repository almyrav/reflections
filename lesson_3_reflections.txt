When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

you might want to use a remote repository if you are collaborating with other people or use
it as a backup in case something happpens to the local machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you might want to check that the remote repository is in the state you want it to be in first

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

forks: used to copy someone else's repository and make it unique to you so you can add and
suggest changes; clones: used to get a repository from a remote server so that you can
modify its files on your local computer; branches: used to organize large projects in a
logical way

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

it is a good idea to keep track of the last known state of the remote on the local
machine to use as comparison 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what
would be harder?

I could collaborate by exchanging files through email or share files through Dropbox; it
would be easier to share files instantly with whomever I want but neither option provides
the organization capabilities that Git or GitHub provides

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

you want to make changes in a separate branch when you are collaborating with others and
you want to make a suggestion; you want to make changes directly in master when you know
it should be in the public version; making the changes in a separate branch allows you to
show your intention without changing the main branch but it is a longer process than
making changes in the master
